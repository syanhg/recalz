llm-based digital architecture for alzheimer's patients

Recalz is an accessible open-source community designed to alleviate the pain experienced by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and their caregivers. Its primary purpose is to create a digital twin that serves as a memory repository, fundamentally mimicking an individual's speech patterns, core memories, and even trivial habits. Additionally, it aims to provide a clinical diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using unobtrusively collected data through casual conversations that do not disturb the patient.
